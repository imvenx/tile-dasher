## OTHER
?- add shadows
?- add objects height, sort ordering based on height
- adjustable difficulty (time tiles take to fall) easy/normal/hard
- power ups / downs:  (or challenge badges etc..)
	- invisibility (player is invisible making it harder to do platforming)	

- sound:
	[x] add player falling sound
	[x] add tile breaking sound and tile falling sound
	[x] add steps sound
	[x] add dash loading/unloadingw sound

- ideas for replayability / completionist / badges
